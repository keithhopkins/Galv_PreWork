				Career Goals
			</h2>
			<p>
				I am looking to begin a new career involving my passion for computers. I have always enjoyed programming in my free time and would love to make a career of it. After graduating from Galvanize I am hoping to find a position working on the website for a food market such as Whole Foods. Sometime down the road I want to work for a company in the gaming industry such as Valve or Blizzard.

				Galvanize Goals

			<p>
				While at Galvanize I really want to make a website that helps people decide what to make for dinner based on the ingredients they have in their refridgerator. My vision is a site that you can enter in the ingredients you want to use then it will develope a recipe for you. This will have to include some ingredients that weren't listed and you will have to option to replace any of those new ingredients and this program will replace them with another ingredient that can replace it.
