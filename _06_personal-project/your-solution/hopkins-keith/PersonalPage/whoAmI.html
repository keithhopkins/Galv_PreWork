				Where do I come from?

			<p>
				I am from Rochester, New York. At the end of April, I moved to Denver with my girlfriend to prepare to start at Galvanize. Starting a career as a web developer has been a goal for a long time and I'm really excited to have it shaping up to be a reality.

			<h2>
				Work and School
			</h2>
			<p>
				After high school I went to Monroe Community College for three years and came out with an Associate's Degree in Computer Science and Psychology. After school I began working my way through the ranks at Wegmans Food Market into management. For the past five years I have been a Front End Coordinator and Trainer. This was a lot of fun for me at first but after training new employees for a few years I felt that I could be doing something more fulfilling with my life. I wanted to get back into programming but found that I had lost touch with what I had learned in school, so I found my way here to Galvanize.
